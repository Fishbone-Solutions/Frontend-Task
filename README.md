# Fishbone Solutions Frontend Task


Welcome Candidate and thank you for taking the time to complete the Fishbone Solutions take-home challenge.

You will have 2 days to complete the assignment. Once you have completed your solution, please reply with a link to a github repository and instructions on how to install / run the application

The goal of this challenge is to build out a voting interactive web app. Please clone this repository and submit it once you are finished.

Here are the rules of this challenge.. you must:

 1) Build an application that displays a list of categories and nominees. 
 Please follow the design in the wireframe below. Run ` start` to start the application.
 2) Use the React `useEffect` hook to fetch the  data from the provided API, and save it to state by using the React `useState` hook.
 [useEffect Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
 [Fetch API Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
[useState Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
 3) When you click on a nominee, we should highlight the nominee card and save the selections using the React `useState` hook. A user can only select one nominee per category, and we should be able to see all of their selections highlighted. The selected nominee card should follow the style guides below.
 4) Make the layout responsive with at least one breakpoint (your choice as to how it looks on a smaller screen width).
 5) Once the user is finished making their selections, they can click on a submit button that displays a results modal screen. A user can dismiss the modal by clicking on the close button (follow the wireframe below).
